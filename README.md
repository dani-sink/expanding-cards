## 🧠 Functionality

- Cards start in a collapsed state.
- When a card is clicked, it is given an `active` class.
- The active card expands, and all others shrink to allow space.
- Smooth transitions enhance the user experience.

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

The component is fully responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes, making it suitable for desktop and mobile experiences.

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project was inspired by [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://50projects50days.com/), a challenge designed to sharpen frontend skills through focused mini-projects. The expanding cards UI was recreated and customized to improve my understanding of responsive layout, transitions, and DOM manipulation.
